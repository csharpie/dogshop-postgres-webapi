dogshop-postgres-webapi
=======================

A simple WebAPI written in C# that uses the Entity Framework ORM and the Npgsql Driver to enable a CRUDy interaction with the Postgres Database.

Oh, and it uses a Dog Shop as an example.

Find the Postgres SQL script called dogshop.sql, inside the parent DogShop folder and run that. It will create the database, dog table, and seed the table.
